# perceptron_classifier
This code applies the perceptron classification algorithm to the iris data set.The weights used for computing the activation function are calculated using the least-square method.This method is different from Rosenblatt's original perceptron rule where the weights are calculated recursively. For simplicity, we perform a binary classification. We only chose the two flower classes Setosa and
Versicolor for practical reasons. However, the perceptron algorithm can be extended to multi-class classificationâ€”for example, through the One-vs.-All technique.

For more information about the implementation of Rosenblatt's perceptron algorithm, see the following book:"Python Machine Learning" by Sebastian Raschka.
